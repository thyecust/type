# Formal Proof

Formal proofs

1. represent arbitrary mathmematical concepts and proofs on a computer, and
2. enable a machine verification of the well-formedness of definitions and of the correctness of proofs.

Whitehead and Russell found a consistent foundation of mathematics in 1910.
Church published a typed lambda calculus based on a variant of Whitehead & Russell's system in 1940.
N.G. de Bruijn introduced dependent types to extend this system in 1970.

## Note

1. There are many proof assistants (formal proof systems) not based on type theory. E.g. Mizar, Metamath. Read [不基于类型论的proof assistant还有发展空间吗？- mcwu](https://www.zhihu.com/question/414388834/answer/1412579377) for more.
