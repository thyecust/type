# Type Theory

In computer science, there are two major branches to the study of type systems:

1. practical: concerns applications to programming languages
2. abstract: connections between computation (pure typed lambda-calculi) and logic

the second one is called type theory. [1]

## Notes

Pure typed lambda-calculi is a non-standard concept used in TAPL, also known as pure simply typed lambda-calculus, and is the origin of [lambda cube](./lambda_cube.md).
